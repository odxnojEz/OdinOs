 <br> OPTION 1: Create APP <br>
  Create a castle defense game for mobile screens, where enemies attack and I can shoot with a cannon to eliminate them. The difficulty should increase as I progress, and I should receive more powerful weapons:<br>

  <br> OPTION 2: Create FUNCTIONALITY <br>
  Create a plugin or functionality that displays all the applications created in the my_apps folder. The style should be similar to how applications are displayed on a mobile phone:<br>

  <br> OPTION 1: Create APP <br>
  Create a solar system simulator that shows how the planets move. Make it mobile so I can control it with my fingers:<br>

  <br> OPTION 1: Create APP <br>
  Create a game similar to Flappy Bird for mobile phones:<br>

  <br> OPTION 2: Create FUNCTIONALITY <br>
  Create a plugin or feature that displays a MacOS-based operating system, where I can control everything in Acornix, and where applications and plugins are displayed. Windows should be moved with my fingers; if I touch a window, it moves on top of the others. If I hold down an application, it is added to the dock. The terminal must communicate with the Termux terminal and must execute real commands, not simulate them:<br>
